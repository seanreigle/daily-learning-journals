#LJ Code 301 - Day 8

Today was a good day. I was able to work on a little bit of my portfolio, which was great, and the morning lab assignment was fairly easy. We are exploring SQL which I've had a little bit of experience with at Expedia, so this will be a good refresher and learning experience for me.
