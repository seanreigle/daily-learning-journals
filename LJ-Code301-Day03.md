#LJ Code 301 - Day 03

Today's assignment went surprisingly well. I think I could understand the concepts that we were using during our pair-programming significantly better than ever before. I am a little worried that I will be overwhelmed with the upcoming work. It seems we are moving quick and with a lot of assignments. I understand that this is an immersive program, but it the way the schedule is set and the extra work assignments, I am concerned I will not have time to either complete the work in its entirety or have any spare time to do anything else! We shall see how it goes!
