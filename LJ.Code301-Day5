#LJ Code 301 - Day 05

I, unfortunately, was absent today for class, but I was able to participate remotely with my partner for pair-programming. At first, the lab was a bit difficult to understand as I've never worked with Handlebars. However, after we started to read the instructions more carefully and look at the resources provided, we were able to figure it out. It was an overall smooth process.
