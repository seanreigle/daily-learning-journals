<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 06</h2>

Oh man did today's lab tell me I honestly don't know what I'm doing. While writing this code, I just tried to tell myself that I was creating a real website for this Pat guy. It was fun to actually see it materialize, even if most of what I've completed was the html layout.

Tomorrow I will work on the lab project some more and hopefully find some direction. I noticed that writing the code that I have now, I felt I had a direction when creating these variables and arrays, but then lost it. I need to be able to plan more first before executing the code writing.
