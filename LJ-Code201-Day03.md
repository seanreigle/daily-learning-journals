<h1> LJ Code 201 - Day 3 </h1>

Today's assignment was rough for me and still is (currently 12:08 AM). For whatever reason, the array, if, and else statements are killing me right now. I'm not sure I have much more energy to keep trying but I know they are due tomorrow by start of class.

I will continue to keep at it and hopefully, can find a solution to the problem.
