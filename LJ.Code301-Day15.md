#LJ Code 301 Day 15

Today was a good day as Ice Cube once said. We worked on a pretty easy lab assignment involving Heroku. At first I thought my deployment worked, but after checking it later on, I found that it does not. I am working on it now to resubmit. I met with my project partners to discuss our upcoming project and everything went smoothly. I am excited to get started...one week left of 301...bittersweet moment.
