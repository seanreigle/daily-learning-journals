<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day10</h1>

Today was awesome! Working in a group of 3 was a bit difficult and at times we butted heads but overall, we were very productive and I am proud of the amount of work we completed. It was a good social experience as well. Being able to communicate and get to know other students was invaluable. I think we need more projects like this.
