<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 15</h1>

Today was a good day. I felt confident in our project pitch and ideas. I feel like all the members of our project team will work efficiently and get shit done. I have a lot of ideas to incorporate into our project and I know my fellow team members do as well.

We went over merge conflicts in GitHub, which I felt very comfortable with as at my previous job, we worked with GitHub almost on a everyday basis. It was great to have that skill set.
