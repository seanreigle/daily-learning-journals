<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 1</h1>

Today started out great for me. We started first with looking at GitHub, which thanks to my previous role at Expedia, I was pretty familiar with. I was tempted to clone repos and start creating pull requests, but I refrained.

Once we got going talking about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I noticed that I got reminded of the work done on CodeAcademy. It was nice to get a refresher. Once we were given our assignments for the day, it was game time.

I had to refer back to my text books several times in my attempt at creating variables in JavaScript. I noticed that I was trying to do "too much" instead of keeping it simple and straight forward. For example, I was trying to do 'if' and 'else' statements instead of reading the instructions fully; it did not call for those conditions. I wasted time doing unnecessary functions and conditions.

All in all, today was a good day. It didn't feel long at all and I was dreading lab time, but it turned out to be an awesome day of learning. I can't wait for tomorrow.
