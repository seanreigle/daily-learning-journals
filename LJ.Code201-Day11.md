#Day 11

Today's project is horrible. I understand that this project combines everything we have learn thus far, but why does it not seem that way? It seems like my brain is melting and I can't seem to grasp the concepts yet. I fear I will need to re-read the textbooks and watch more class videos to understand more. Hopefully, I can make this happen before project week.
