#LJ Code 301 - Day 13

Today we went over project ideas and there was a few interesting ideas that I would be excited to work on. I am looking forward to starting project week! We also reviewed page.js which was surprisingly 'easy' to understand and comprehend. I also look forward to using more of that in the future.
